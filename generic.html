								<h2>My journey</h2>
								<p>I learned my first coding experience in class XI, starting with the C++ language, which piqued my interest in coding. I opted for Commerce with Computer Science, and while developing an interest in computers,</p>
								<p>I pursued a Graduation in Computer Applications at Chandigarh University. It was a drastic change in my learning journey. There, I learned about databases, some basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It was also where I was introduced to my base language, Java. I was drawn to Java because I felt its power, and using it, I created a Shopping Mall Management System, employing Applets as the User Interface and MySQL as the storage database. This project truly boosted my confidence as it was my first fully-developed product in IT</p>
								<p>Subsequently, I gained admission to Amrita Vishwavidyapeetham in Kerala for an MCA program, where I learned more advanced topics and had my first conference research paper published, utilizing Python, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing models.</p>
